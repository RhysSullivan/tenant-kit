# Tenant Kit

A toolkit for building multi-tenant applications. The goal of this project is to provide components, documentation, and utilities for handling custom domains, authentication, and customization across multiple tenants.

This is a highly work in progress project being built in public, it will be incomplete and there will be lots of iteration.

Open issues, PRs, and tweet feedback at me to make this better.



## Planned topics

Domains
- Custom domains i.e tenant.example.com
- Subpaths i.e example.com/tenant
- Using a custom domain as a handle i.e Bluesky (ATProtocol)

Customization
- Supporting custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Adding built in support for most analytics providers

Authentication
- Auth across subdomains, subpaths, and custom domains

Hosting
- Multi tenancy on Vercel
- Multi tenancy on Cloudflare
- Multi tenancy on a $5 VPS
